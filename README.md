#MemoBook ToDo List App

###Description
Welcome to my project! This is a MemoBook App made in Swift with the SwiftUI framework. It allows users to easily track daily tasks that need to be done and those that have already been completed. American author Simon Sinek often emphasizes the importance of writing down goals to incentivize ourselves to meet them and be rewarded by the following Dopamine. The UI in this application is meant to resemble that of a memo book page to achieve the simplicity and feel of the low-tech alternative with the help of clean and dynamic animations.

This application leverages the Core Data framework as a lightweight persistent data storage for individual task information. Local notifications are pushed to the user when necessary to bring attention to time-sensitive tasks. The project follows MVVM software architecture.
